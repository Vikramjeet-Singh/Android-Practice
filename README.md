Android-Practice
================

This is an app built as a pre-requisite for CodePath’s Android class.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total
Completed user stories:
•	Required: User can add a new entry/task to the list.
•	Required: User can see the list of tasks in a TableView/ListView
•	Required: User can delete a task from the list by long pressing the task row.
•	Required: User can open the Edit view by tapping on a task
•	Required: User can save the edited task to the original task list by clicking Save button
•	Required: Tasks in the list persist after app is closed and reopened

•	Suggested: Custom Adapter is implemented  that displays both task and the completion due date
•	Suggested: Dialog Fragment opens up to edit an existing task
•	Suggested: Completion due date is shown. Its just minimalistic. Its always due the next day (haven’t used any sophisticated logic in this)

Note: Got a warning saying “Gradle Sync failed”. Not sure why am I getting this warning and how to fix this

Had some trouble serializing “Date” object. (Probably just lack of Android framework understanding)
