:app:lintVitalRelease/Users/Vikramjeet/Documents/AndroidProjects/SimpleToDo/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_edit_item.xml:32: Error: The id "editedText" is not defined anywhere. [UnknownId]
        android:layout_toEndOf="@+id/editedText" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnknownId":
   The @+id/ syntax refers to an existing id, or creates a new one if it has
   not already been defined elsewhere. However, this means that if you have a
   typo in your reference, or if the referred view no longer exists, you do
   not get a warning since the id will be created on demand. This check
   catches errors where you have renamed an id without updating all of the
   references to it.
